-- ORDERING RESULTS

-- Populations of all states from largest to smallest.

-- States sorted alphabetically (A-Z) within their census region. The census regions are sorted in reverse alphabetical (Z-A) order.

-- The biggest park by area
SELECT MAX park_name, area

-- LIMITING RESULTS

-- The 10 largest cities by populations

-- The 20 oldest parks from oldest to youngest in years, sorted alphabetically by name.

-- CONCATENATING OUTPUTS

-- All city names and their state abbreviation.

-- Average population across all the states. Note the use of alias, common with aggregated values.

-- Total population in the West and South census regions
SELECT SUM(population) AS total_population_west_south

-- The number of cities with populations greater than 1 million
SELECT COUNT (population) AS cities_with_pop_larger_than_1mill

-- The number of state nicknames.

-- Count the number of cities in each state, ordered from most cities to least.

-- Miscelleneous

-- While you can use LIMIT to limit the number of results returned by a query,
-- it's recommended to use OFFSET and FETCH if you want to get
-- "pages" of results.
-- For instance, to get the first 10 rows in the city table
-- ordered by the name, you could use the following query.
-- (Skip 0 rows, and return only the first 10 rows from the sorted result set.)



-- SUBQUERIES (optional)

-- Include state name rather than the state abbreviation while counting the number of cities in each state,


-- Include the names of the smallest and largest parks


-- List the capital cities for the states in the Northeast census region.
