Bug 1
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getTimesheetsByEmployeeId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_employee
Expected output:
2
Actual output:
1
How did you fix this bug?
Changed the if to a while loop. We are working with a List that returns
all timesheets by employee_id, so we need a while loop to go through the SqlRowSet
results and add the timesheets to our List.

Test that demonstrates problem:
getTimesheetsByProjectId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_project
Expected output:
3
Actual output:
2
How did you fix this bug?
The SQL statement was incorrect. It was selecting from timesheet
where employee_id = ? instead of project_id.

Test that demonstrates problem:
updated_timesheet_has_expected_values_when_retrieved

Expected output:

Actual output:

How did you fix this bug?
This is passing because (I think) booleans default to false, but it's
not actually updating in our database. There is no SET boolean = ? in
the SQL statement and no updatedTimesheet.getBillable() in the jdbcTemplate.update statement.

Bug 4
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getBillableHours_returns_correct_total
Expected output:
2.0
Actual output:
0.0
How did you fix this bug?
In the WHERE, there should be a AND billable = true,
otherwise this method is summing the hours_worked whether or not
they are billable and that's not what we want!
