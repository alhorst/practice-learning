                <h2>Famous quotes by Mulder and Scully!</h2>
                <p>Dana Scully:</p>
                <blockquote>The truth is out there, but so are lies.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Nothing happens in contradiction to nature.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>I don't have time for your convenient ignorance.</blockquote>
                <p>Fox Mulder:</p>
                <blockquote>It looks like this person was born without footprints. Which is impossible, by the way.
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>I know what I'm doing.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>All we can do, Scully, is pull the thread, see what it unravels.</blockquote>
